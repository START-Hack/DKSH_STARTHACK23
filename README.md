## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

Pharmacies in Asia offer a wide range of services combining a mix of different touchpoints to the patient.  However, these touchpoints to patients are fragmented with limited connectivity in between. 

As a Market Expansion Services provider, DKSH is looking to support our pharmacy partners with a one-stop digital pharmacy solution that combines their portfolio of offerings and enables a seamless patient care experience. Basic features should include:-

-	Browse and purchase OTC / non-prescription medicine online (with option for in-store pick-up, or home delivery)
-	Book and order medical services incl. home healthcare services (nurse to visit and perform at-home blood and basic health checks), in-pharmacy blood draw and health check-up and telemedicine
-	Beyond these basic features, teams should explore any related features and/or services that  can upgrade and deliver an integrated patient journey. Focus is on usability and convenience. 
-	Key point of consideration: patient data confidentiality
